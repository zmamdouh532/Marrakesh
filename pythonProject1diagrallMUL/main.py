def analyze_communication_diagram(diagram_name):
  # Use your chosen UML tool to open the diagram named diagram_name
# Extract and count the number of stakeholders and communication pathways from the diagram
  # Example using UMLet:
  # with open(diagram_name, "r") as file:
  #   content = file.read()
  #   # Parse content to extract stakeholder names and communication pathways
  #   # Replace this example with your tool's specific parsing logic
  # stakeholders = []
  # communication_paths = 0
  #   # ...
  return stakeholders, communication_paths

# Example usage
stakeholders, communication_paths = analyze_communication_diagram("conflicting_requirements.uml")

print("Stakeholders:", stakeholders)
print("Number of communication pathways:", communication_paths)
